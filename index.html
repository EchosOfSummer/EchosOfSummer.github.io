                <p>Hello, my name is Neebinnodin Buswa and 35 years old. My name is Ojibwe and means "Summer Wind". I usually go by Neebin. So, my english name is 'Summer' and no I will never answer if addressed as Summer. I won't know if you talking to me. Oh, my last name names 'Echo' or 'Echomaker'.</p>
                <p>I currently live in Appleton. I lived most of my life in Michigan. I was born in Sault Ste Marie, Michigan, grow up in Two Rivers, Wisconsin, and spend most of my teens in Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I spent 14 years of my life in prison, but I just recently got off of a two-year parole. Now I'm trying to further my education.</p>
                <p>I'm currently in the IT Software Developer program. This is the second time I'm taking this class. I didn't do well this last spring. Personnel issues and life challenges got in the way. Looking to get back on track. When I first started at FVTC I was in the Industrail Engineering Technologies, but I switched my program in August 2023.</p>
                <p>I enjoy reading books more than watching TV or movies. I've read alot of books and would have to say fantasy is my favorite genre. I have two series that are my favorite:</p>
